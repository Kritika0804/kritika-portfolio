    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">About Me</h1>
    
    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Hey! I'm <strong>Kritika Choudhary</strong>, a passionate Software Engineer based in Pune, India, 
      specializing in building robust data pipelines and real-time streaming solutions that power scalable analytics and transactional workflows.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">My Journey</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Currently working as a <strong>Software Engineer at Finvu AA</strong>, I focus on building and optimizing 
      data pipelines using Python, Java, and Apache Kafka. My work involves deploying and managing services on 
      Kubernetes across both on-premises and cloud environments, ensuring high availability and operational efficiency.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Previously, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a <strong>Software Development Intern at Amazon</strong> 
      in Bangalore, where I collaborated with the Amazon Payment team to improve seller experience. I designed and 
      implemented asynchronous bulk operations using AWS services like DynamoDB, S3, and Lambda functions, gaining 
      valuable experience in microservices architecture and API design.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      My journey also includes a <strong>Research and Development Internship at DRDO</strong>, where I researched 
      algorithms for object detection systems and AR/VR Technology for defense applications, presenting findings to 
      senior engineers and scientists.
